  A GNU Emacs major mode for editing BNF grammars.

        “Precise language is not the problem.  Clear language is
        the problem.”

        Richard Feynman

  Currently provides basic syntax and font-locking for BNF files.  BNF
  notation is supported exactly form as it was first announced in the
  ALGOL 60 report.  EBNF and ABNF are not supported but their
  implementation is planned in the near future.

  When developing this mode, the following documents were taken into
  account:

  • [Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60]
  • [RFC822]: Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages
  • [RFC5234]: Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF
  • [RFC7405]: Case-Sensitive String Support in ABNF

1.1 Features
────────────

  • Basic syntax definition
  • Syntax highlighting


1.2 Installation
────────────────

  Known to work with GNU Emacs 24.3 and later.  BNF Mode may work with
  older versions of Emacs, or with other flavors of Emacs (e.g. XEmacs)
  but this is /not/ guaranteed.  Bug reports for problems related to
  using BNF Mode with older versions of Emacs will most like not be
  addressed.

  The master of all the material is the Git repository at
  <https://github.com/sergeyklay/bnf-mode> .

  NOTE: The `master' branch will always contain the latest unstable
  version.  If you wish to check older versions or formal, tagged
  release, please switch to the relevant [tag].

  The recommended way is to use [ELPA], [MELPA Stable] or [MELPA]. If
  either is in your `package-archives', do:

  ┌────
  │ M-x package-install RET bnf-mode RET
  └────

  To learn on how to use any other installation methods refer to
  relevant documentation.
